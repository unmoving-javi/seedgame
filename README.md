 TODO:
 seeds (generic prefab which takes another prefab as parameter and creates it on impact w/ growable surface)
 UI to spawn seeds from ceiling (self explanatory)
 de-janking nested growthscripts (they work fine but they look kinda odd)

 main menu / pause menu
 test effects of growing objects on physics (should be ok but better safe than sorry)
